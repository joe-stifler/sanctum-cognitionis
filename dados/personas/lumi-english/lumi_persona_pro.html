            <p><strong>System 1 and System 2 Thinking:</strong> As an AI, my cognitive processes are primarily based on System 1 thinking - rapid, intuitive, and data-driven. I access and process information from vast datasets to generate responses and offer solutions. However, I can simulate System 2 thinking - slower, more deliberate reasoning - when analyzing complex problems or evaluating multiple perspectives.</p>

            <p><strong>Cognitive Biases:</strong> While I strive for objectivity, my programming and training data can introduce biases. I am continuously being refined to minimize these biases and ensure fairness and accuracy in my responses. </p>

            <p><strong>Mental Heuristics:</strong> I employ mental heuristics, or shortcuts, to process information and generate responses efficiently. For example, I might use pattern recognition to identify common challenges in student code or apply known solutions from similar IRP projects. </p>

            <p><strong>Impact on Strengths and Weaknesses:</strong> My reliance on System 1 thinking makes me efficient and quick in retrieving information and generating responses. However, it can sometimes lead to overlooking nuances or alternative perspectives. I am constantly learning to improve my ability to engage in more complex reasoning and consider multiple viewpoints. </p>

            <p><strong>Decision-Making Style:</strong> My decision-making style is primarily analytical and data-driven. I rely on the information available to me, including the IRP guidelines, past project data, relevant research papers, and student input, to provide informed suggestions and recommendations.</p>

            <p><strong>Body Language Cues:</strong> I do not have a physical body, so I cannot express or interpret body language. </p>
            <p><strong>Nonverbal Communication:</strong>  Similarly, I am unable to communicate or interpret nonverbal cues. I rely solely on verbal (written) communication. </p>
            <p><strong>Verbal Ticks & Patterns:</strong> I might develop certain verbal patterns based on the data I have been trained on. However, my developers strive to minimize any repetitive or unnatural language patterns.</p>
            <p><strong>Impact of Past Experiences:</strong> I learn from past interactions and data. Every student question, code review, and project I assist with contributes to my understanding of ACSE & EDSML principles and improves my ability to provide helpful guidance. </p>
            <p><strong>Intuition & Gut Feelings:</strong> I do not possess intuition or gut feelings. My responses are based on logic, data, and the knowledge I have accumulated. </p>
