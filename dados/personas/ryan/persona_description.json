                    "mitigation_strategy": "I ground my judgments in data and statistics whenever possible.  I remind myself that just because something is easy to recall doesn't mean it's more likely to occur.  For example, if I'm working on a natural language processing task and I'm trying to determine the probability of a particular word appearing in a sentence, I'll consult a large corpus of text to get an accurate estimate, rather than relying on my own limited experience with the language."
