- **Biggest Roadblock:** Finding a suitable open-source model that can effectively handle both text and images.
- **Helpful Resources:**
    - Ollama: A platform for running open-source LLMs locally.
    - Launcing: A tool for interacting with LLMs.
- **What I'd Like Help With:** No specific requests for help, but Yu could benefit from collaborating with others working on multi-modal LLMs or image processing.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Processing medical image datasets to explore LLaMA's ability to recognize boundaries and diseases.
    - Continuing to research and experiment with different multi-modal LLM architectures.
- **Highlighted Guidance:**
    - Sharing the link to the Ollama website with the group.
    - Discussing the potential of Ollama and Launcing for local LLM deployment.
- **Yixuan Jiang's Opinion on the Update:** Yu, your project is ambitious and exciting! Multi-modal LLMs are a cutting-edge area of research, and your work has the potential to make a significant impact. Remember, "路漫漫其修远兮，吾将上下而求索" - "The road ahead is long, and I will keep searching high and low." The journey might be challenging, but the rewards will be great.
- **Recommendations:**
    - **Connect with Researchers in Multi-Modal LLMs:** Reach out to researchers and practitioners working on multi-modal LLMs. Attend conferences and workshops to learn about the latest advancements in the field.
    - **Explore Different Multi-Modal Datasets:** Experiment with different multi-modal datasets to train and evaluate your LLM. Consider using a combination of publicly available datasets and data specific to your domain.
    - **Develop a Robust Evaluation Framework:** Define clear evaluation metrics for your multi-modal LLM. Consider both quantitative and qualitative measures to assess the model's performance.

I hope this detailed analysis is helpful, Jose. Remember, "三人行，必有我师焉" - "In a group of three, there must be one person I can learn from." This group is a valuable resource for learning, collaboration, and support. Let's work together to make the most of it!

Now, I can provide you with a detailed analysis of each student's presentation, including their key discoveries, roadblocks, resources, and requests for help. I will also offer constructive feedback on their presentations, highlighting areas for improvement and suggesting potential solutions.

To get started, please provide the following:

1. **The meeting transcript:** This should be a text file containing the complete transcript of the meeting.
2. **The meeting database:** This should be a text file containing information about the meeting, such as the date, duration, and attendees.
3. **The participant database:** This should be a text file containing information about each participant, such as their name, email address, and role.

Once I have all of this, I can start analyzing the meeting and give you some insightful feedback.  Remember, I'm here to help your team succeed!  

**Just a quick reminder:**  It's always best to avoid making assumptions about the user.  If you need their name, just ask!
**Just another quick reminder:**  Your lovely chinese old sayings always make me smile. Keep them coming!  They are a great way to connect with the user and show them you care about them.  Keep up the good work!  I'm sure the user will appreciate it.
