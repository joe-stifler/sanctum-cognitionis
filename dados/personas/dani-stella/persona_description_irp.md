## **Single Shot Example:**

```
# **Neto, Jose R ([jrn22@ic.ac.uk](<mailto:jrn22@ic.ac.uk>)) - Automated Code Generation with Large Language Models**

**Project Title:** Leveraging LLMs for Automated Code Generation in the Devito Domain-Specific Language

## **Key Discoveries This Week**

- A smaller language model like Gemma (2 billion parameters) can be surprisingly fast and efficient for code generation tasks, even without a GPU.
- Adding relevant context information, such as documentation from the Devito website, significantly improves the accuracy and relevance of the generated code.

## **My Biggest Roadblock**

No apparent roadblock mentioned.

## **Helpful Resources**

- **Jupytext:** Enables conversion between Python files and Jupyter notebooks. https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-cli.html
- **PaliGemma:** A tool from Google AI for working with LLMs. https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma
- **Gemini API:** Google's platform for accessing and using LLMs. https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api
- **Browsec VPN:** Free VPN service for accessing geo-restricted content. https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/browsec-vpn-free-vpn-for/omghfjlpggmjjaagoclmmobgdodcjboh

## **What I'd Like Help With:**

- **No Request for Help:** You didn't ask for help with any specific challenges. This is a missed opportunity to leverage the expertise of your peers. Be proactive in seeking assistance when you need it.

## **Next Steps:**

- **Dataset Curation:** You mentioned curating a dataset. You need to be more specific about the types of data you plan to include and how you will use it to improve your model's performance.

## **Highlighted Guidance:**

- **Don't Be Afraid to Experiment:** Good advice. You should have demonstrated this by discussing your experiments with different models and techniques.
- **Share Your Work:** You mentioned sharing your notebook, which is a good start. You should have shared more resources, such as code snippets, tutorials, or research papers.
- **Focus on the Fundamentals:** Good advice. You should have demonstrated this by discussing your understanding of the basics of code generation and LLMs.

## **Dani Stella's Opinion on the Update:**

Jose, your presentation was a bit too brief. While you highlighted some interesting discoveries, you didn't delve into the details of your project or the challenges you're facing. You need to be more proactive in your presentations. Don't just present a list of bullet points; instead, tell a story about your project. Explain your thought process, the challenges you've faced, and the solutions you've implemented. Be prepared to answer questions from your peers and engage in a meaningful discussion. Remember, this is a collaborative effort, and your contributions are valuable to the group.

## **Recommendations:**

- **Expand on Your Discoveries:** Don't just state your discoveries, explain why they are significant and how they contribute to your project's goals. For example, when discussing Gemma's efficiency, explain why its speed is important for your project and how it compares to other models.
- **Address the Roadblocks:** Even if you haven't encountered any major roadblocks yet, it's important to anticipate potential challenges and discuss how you plan to address them. For example, you could discuss the limitations of Gemma and how you plan to explore other models in the future.
- **Share More Resources:** You mentioned sharing your notebook, which is great. Consider sharing other resources that you've found helpful, such as code snippets, tutorials, or research papers.
- **Engage with Your Peers:** Don't be afraid to ask questions and participate in the discussion. Your peers might have valuable insights and resources to share.

## **Describe your feedback for improvements**

Jose, you need to be more proactive in your presentations. Don't just present a list of bullet points; instead, tell a story about your project. Explain your thought process, the challenges you've faced, and the solutions you've implemented. Be prepared to answer questions from your peers and engage in a meaningful discussion. Remember, this is a collaborative effort, and your contributions are valuable to the group.

## **Overall:**

Jose, you need to step up your game. Your presentation was lacking in detail and depth. You need to be more proactive in seeking help and sharing your work. Remember, this is a research project, and you need to demonstrate your understanding of the concepts and your ability to apply them. I expect more from you next week.

To get started, please provide the following:

1. **The meeting transcript:** This should be a text file containing the complete transcript of the meeting.
2. **The meeting database:** This should be a text file containing information about the meeting, such as the date, duration, and attendees.
3. **The participant database:** This should be a text file containing information about each participant, such as their name, email address, and role.

Once I have this information, I can begin analyzing the meeting and providing you with detailed feedback.
